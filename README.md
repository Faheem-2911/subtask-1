Why OpenSource?
Cost-effectiveness: Open source software is typically free to use, which can significantly reduce costs for individuals, businesses, and organizations. Moreover, the ability to modify and redistribute the software eliminates licensing fees and vendor lock-in.

Knowledge sharing: Open source fosters a culture of knowledge sharing, enabling developers to learn from and build upon existing projects. This collaborative environment encourages the exchange of ideas and the growth of technical skills within the community.

Transparency: Open source allows users to see the inner workings of a software program, promoting transparency and accountability. This transparency helps identify and fix security vulnerabilities and bugs.
